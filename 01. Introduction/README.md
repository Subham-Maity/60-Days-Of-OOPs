So imagine you have a YouTube channel and it's filled with lots of videos. These videos are organized into playlists, like a playlist for music videos and a playlist for comedy videos. Each video has its own set of comments and likes.

Now in OOPs(object oriented programming) we have objects and classes. So in this example,

All the videos are objects and the class is the Playlist. So, every object means video has its own set of comments and likes. So, in this example, we can say that the comments and likes are the properties of the video object.

Then what is OOPs üò•‚ùì Solving a problem using objects is called object-oriented programming.

Let's say you have a collection of toy cars. Each toy car is different - some are red, some are blue, some are small, some are big, etc. But they are all toy cars.

In object-oriented programming (OOP), you can use a class to represent the concept of a toy car. The class would define what a toy car is (it's a small model car that can be played with) and what it can do (it can be rolled along the ground, it can be painted different colors, etc.).

The class would be like a blueprint for making toy cars. You can use the blueprint to make as many toy cars as you want, each one with its own set of characteristics (color, size, etc.). Each toy car is an object of the "ToyCar" class.

So, in real life, a class is like a blueprint for making something. And an object is an instance of that blueprint.

Then what is Class üò•‚ùì A class is a blueprint for creating objects.

‚≠ê Object[](#-object)

Imagine you're at a store that sells shoes. Each shoe in the store is an object of the "Shoe" class. Each shoe has its own unique characteristics like brand, color, size, and price.

The class "Shoe" defines what a shoe is and what it can do. For example, the class may have a method for trying on a shoe or a method for buying a shoe. Each shoe object can use these methods to perform the corresponding actions.

So, each shoe in the store is an object of the "Shoe" class. And each object has its own set of characteristics and actions. And each shoe can be bought by different customers.

Then what is Object üò•‚ùì A Object is an instance of a class.
